To-do-list-App

A To-Do List App is a simple productivity application that helps users manage tasks or daily activities efficiently. It provides a clean interface for users to:

1.Add new tasks
2.Mark tasks as completed
3.Delete tasks
4.Keep track of what needs to be done

Whether it's used for personal goals, grocery lists, project steps, or reminders — it’s a powerful tool to stay organized and focused.

🎯 Purpose
1.The main purpose of a To-Do List App is to help users:
2.Organize their work or study schedule
3.Increase productivity by breaking goals into manageable steps
4.Track progress by marking completed tasks

🧩 Key Functionalities
1.Add Task
Users can type a task into an input field and click "Add" to display it in a list.

2.Mark as Done
Clicking on a task or checkbox marks it as completed (often shown with strikethrough or color change).

3.Delete Task
A delete button (e.g., ❌) removes tasks that are no longer needed.

4.Clear All / Filter Tasks (optional)
Some apps may allow clearing all tasks or filtering (e.g., All, Completed, Active).

HTML5 – Structure

CSS3 – Styling

JavaScript – Interactivity

Bootstrap 5 – Responsive layout and components

JavaScript – for dynamic behavior (adding, updating, removing tasks)

It’s a great way to learn DOM manipulation, event handling, and optionally local storage for saving tasks.
